#A few words to all who professe themselves to be of the Protestant religion whereby they may understand by what spirit they were led, that persecuted the people of God in former ages, for the exercise of their religion, and their tenderness of conscience in matters relating to the worship of God : with a few words of comfort to the suffering lambes / written by him that would have the greatest of persecutors to repent, and cease to do evil, and learn to do well, that so they might escape the judgments of the Lord, F.E.#
